<P>The device dialog might be used to start and stop data collection.
Data can exclusively received, the meter device dictates the time steps between two data point (time step -1.0 msec).
The time step between measurement can be adjusted, for example long term measurements. 
But only time step values above 1500.0 msec make a difference (example 60000.0 msec for one measurement/minute).
It is showing information about the adjusted measurement type and battery condition. 
</P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Usage</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P>Afterwards the serial communication port adjustments are done
using the device selection dialog the start button can be used to
initiate data collection. 
Nevertheless the "start gathering" button can be used instead without opening this dialog. 
</P>

</P>
<P>Switching the measurement type at the multimeter itself will create a new data set.
</P>
<P>Pushing the "stop" button will stop gathering data.
