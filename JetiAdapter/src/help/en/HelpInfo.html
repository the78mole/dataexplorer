<P>
The below device dialog should be used to configure the visualization of measurements.
It is possible to update measurement names and symbols. 
Even if the measurement units are editable it makes less sense to do without adding a measurement factor in respect to the change.
The measurement names and units are contained within the log data and get overwritten while reading.
Unchecked measurement will not be displayed. 
Curves without reasonable data are not displayed either.
This will lead to a more clear representation.
Curves which are hard to be interpreted in two dimensional way, may be blanked out.
As example, if no GPS is connected the GPS relevant curves doesn't get displayed.
</BR>
It is possible to import data files using the 'open input file' button as well.
</BR></BR>
The GPS data measurements which are needed to display tracks in Google Earth or to export KMZ/KML do not have a fixed ordinal due to the way the log data are recorded.
Latitude, Longitude and the absolute altitude (GPS altitude) are detected as far as possible by naming.
While GPS data are available and detected it is possible to load and display such data in Google Earth using KMZ files.
This files can be exported using the file menu or directly launched to an installed Google Earth application.
How to do so, refer to <A HREF="../../../help/en/HelpInfo_36.html">Toolbar -> Google Earth</A>.

<P>
There are two prepared measurement set configurations to be used for different sensor sets.
The above screen shot showing the dialog of a loaded log and here you see its reduced to the available measurement set.
Using the device properties editor it would be possible to add some more or simply re-name the configuration set, if this is really required.
</P>
<P>
At the right hand side of the configuration panel are check boxes which enable a semi-automatic scale synchronization.
While checking measurement name will be compared to previous once and the fitting measurement ordinal will be added to the measurement configuration entry.
Using scale synchronization will reduce the required space for scales and spend more for the graphics. 
Overlaying curves in this matter will allow direct comparison without using the curve compare window.
</P>
<P>
The names of curves should be unique for this sensor set if possible, sample CurrentMotor, CurrentRx, VoltageMotor, VoltageRx.
Please choose the curve names, in case of scale synchronization, in a way that the names starts with the same word, 
sample Current synchronized to <I>Current</I>Motor, <I>Current</I>Rx, <I>Current</I>Motor2.
This is the algorithm the semi-automatic synchronization works.
Using the DevicePropertiesEditor it is possible to synchronize almost every curve to another by configuration.
Sure, this makes only sense for curves where use somehow matching range of values.
While the curves and data match it is possible to select the synchronization check boxes.

To archive all capabilities of DataExplorer's statistical calculations refer to <A HREF="../../../help/en/HelpInfo_5.html">Statistic View Window</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Hint: </B>While changing curve names, symbols units or synchronization entries the device configuration file gets changed.
With a later version of DataExplorer the device properties schema might change (DeviceProperties_Vxy.xsd), 
in this case a backup copy of the complete device configurations will be created (Devices_Vxy-1.xsd) and your change will remain there.
The out dated device configuration file can be used as template to update the new version.
