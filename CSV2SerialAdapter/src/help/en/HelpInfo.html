<P>The device dialog is used to configure the visualization of the displayed data.
Using the "open file" button a file selection dialog enable to open new files while applying the current visible
visualization configuration.
The dialog is build up dynamically and might be different for each device.
As example two different dialogs are shown:
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_1.png" NAME="Image1" ALT="Image1"><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_2.png" NAME="Image2" ALT="Image2">
</P>
<P>Hint: The configured visualization profile is also used if a channel/configuration is selected using the tools bar combo box
and the data are imported with the "import file" button.
</P>
<DIV TYPE=HEADER>
	<H2><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>AV4ms grater or equal Firmware Version 4.67</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
</DIV>
<P>Using the dialog it is possible to adapt measurement names and units.
In normal case this should not be required.
DataExplorer can read live data by a serial connection to the charger. 
Alternatively it is possible to import textual data, which are gathered by a RS232-data-logger and stored to a USB stick.
</BR>
Using the menu or the import button of this dialog it is possible to import such data.

<P>Hint: Depending on the firmware some channel/configurations might be unused and therefore it does not show curves.
