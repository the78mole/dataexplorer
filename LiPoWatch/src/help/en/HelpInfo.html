<P>The LiPoWatch device dialog is to be used to visualize and adjust of
the LiPoWatch &quot;Settings&quot;. Using the last tabulator &quot;Data

</P>
<P>A lot of hints are available by tool tips of the dialog itself and
make this help nearly obsolete. The tool tips are visible by hovering
the mouse over the fields of interest. 
</P>
<P>The actual implementation fits the firmware version 1.0. 
</P>

recording group is pushed the UniLog itself will log the data
internal.</P>
