	Device Dialog Introduction</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
</DIV>
<P>The UniLog device dialog is to be used to visualize and adjust of
the UniLog &quot;Settings&quot;. Using the last tabulator &quot;Data
I/O&quot; the data stored in the device can be read and visualized. To
manipulate the visualization the four configuration tabs might be
used. At this place everybody can create there own configuration with
meaningful names. In initial, as recommendation, there are</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>Height, simple height measurement with low
	additional weight for the model plane 
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>Receiver, additional to the height the receiver
	supply power can be measured to get reasonable values to estimate
	required power consumption for the voltage regulator 
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>Motor, to measure the motor power and efficiency
	to dimension the motor controller or propeller 
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>Velocity, influence of the prop to the flight
	velocity or simple get a feeling for the planes speed 
	</P>
</UL>
<P>Alternative the configurations can be adjusted to fit personal
requirements or simply model names like Model_1 to Model_4. 
</P>
<P>A lot of hints are available by tool tips of the dialog itself and
make this help nearly obsolete. The tool tips are visible by hovering
the mouse over the fields of interest. 
</P>
<P>The actual implementation fits the firmware version 1.10. 
</P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>The „Settings“ Tabulator</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P>Afterwards the serial communication is configured using the device
selection dialog and the device dialog is opened it is possible to
query the UniLog internal setting by pushing the button “Read
UniLog settings”. Such a view with queried settings is shown in
picture 1.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_1.png" NAME="Image 1" ALT="Image 1">
</P>
<P>All analog outlets are to be pre-configured starting with firmware 1.10. 
By activating the limiter function the signal to the motor controller are reduced reaching the adjusted consumed energy. 
To enable this functionality the controller signal must go through the UniLog. 
An activated limiter will also set the time step to 1/16 Second and only one data collection is possible.
</P>

<P>If settings are modified the button “”Write UniLog settings”
gets activated. Pushing this buttons will write the modified settings
data into the UniLog device. 
</P>
<P><B>Hint : </B>It is meaningful to read at first UniLog setting
before modifying, otherwise some dialog defaults will be written into
the device. 
</P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>The „Data I/O“ Tabulator</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P>Initially all buttons are active to read log data from the UniLog.
With selecting a specific configuration, tabs 2 to 5 will be
explained next section, this selected configuration will be applied
to the red data. But it is possible to switch data configurations
later for each data set individual. 
</P>
<P>Only the “delete” button is extra. Pushing this button the
data are marked for deletion. The deletion gets active next time a
log operation is started. The data stored within can still be read. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_2.png" NAME="Image 2" ALT="Image 2">
</P>
<P>After pushing “Start reading data” all the data within the
device are going to be red and the read operation starts immediately and the selected
configuration is applied.</P>
<P>Using the button “Start live data recording” a query cycle is
initiated which reads according the device settings and connected
sensors and the data are displayed in graphics, as digital and as
analog displays. If the button “Start” within the UniLog data
recording group is pushed the UniLog itself will log the data
internal.</P>
<P>By pushing start* buttons as reaction the stop* buttons are
getting activated.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_3.png" NAME="Image 3" ALT="Image 3">
</P>
<P>At the end of the read operation the data are displayed. The
dialog gets back to its initial state. Only the progress bar is
filled and the number of red data telegrams are displayed.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_4.png" NAME="Image 4" ALT="Image 4">
</P>
<P>The Data I/O Tabulator enables to modify the configuration names.
To change a configuration name it is required to push at first the
button “Change name” to activate the change mode. After editing
the name the operation is committed by the enter button. The new name
will be displayed in the tabulator changed and will made persistent
in the device configuration file.</P>
<H2><A NAME="config_tab"></A><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>The
Configuration Tabulators</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P>This complex tabulator is showing all device possible
measurements. Only the real measurements representing a device sensor
connection has a check box to enable activation. If a measurement
gets activated the depended measurements are getting activated too.
As sample the receiver configuration tab will be explained. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_5.png" NAME="Image 5" ALT="Image 5">
</P>
<P>If the measurement “Height” will be selected the dependent
measurement slope calculation with its two combo boxes gets
activated.</P>
<P>For the slope calculation one of two regression types has to be
selected as well a regression interval time between 1 and 20 seconds.
</P>
<P>Each change will be immediate change the data set visualization. A
change will also activate the “Persist adjustments as default”
button to make the configuration composition persistent and will be
used next time data are gets applied to this configuration.
</P>
<P>Special are the 3 analog connectors (A1 to A3). All analog outlets are
pre-configured using the device settings (Settings tab). This will
adjust UniLog internal measurement adjustment. 
While reading data this UniLog internal settings are used to adjust name and unit for each analog measurement.
If required for the connected sensor an offset as well as a factor can
be used for adaption. A change will activate the “Persist
adjustments as default” button to enable to persist the change for
later repeated usage. 
</P>
<P>If a data set is just displayed while opening the dialog the dialog
tab with the matching configuration is displayed on top. Does the
data set displayed not match the configuration the configuration might
be adapted or a better matching configuration selecting another tab
can be selected. By doing this a message box pops up to commit or
de-commit this operation. 
</P>
<P>
Different configurations enable different statistics data calculation.
As sample the next screen shot displays a receiver configuration statistics view.
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_6.png" NAME="Image 6" ALT="Image 6 displays a statistics view of a receiver measurement" BORDER=0>
</P>
<P>
Below a motor measurement statistics view is displayed. All important calculation data and differences are red circled.
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_7.png" NAME="Image 7" ALT="Image 7 displays a statistics view of a motor measurement" BORDER=0>
</P>
<P> 
For later it is planned to enable the adaption of the statistic configuration by a dialog.
</P>
<P><B>Hint : </B>If four configurations are to much it can be
reduced. This requires to comment out channel configuration in
UniLog.xml (&lt;!-- XML comment --&gt;). More then four
configurations are possible but the current implementation does not
support. 
</P>
<P>Of course it is possible to activate all measurements in the
configuration tab and filter using the curve selector.
</P>

<H2><A NAME="telemetry"></A><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Der
„Telemetry“ Tabulator</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P>Using this tab it is possible to adjust all telemetry relevant configurations which are supported by the transmitter/receiver systems involved.
Actual supported transmitter/receiver systems are Jeti Duplex, Futaba and Multiplex M-Link, since UniLog Firmwarelevel 1.12.
At first the actual UniLog configuration should be red and afterwords, with help of the transmitter/receiver systems manual, change the configuration as required. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_8.png" NAME="Image8" ALT="Image8 Telemetry Tabulator" BORDER=0>
</P>
<P>While an configuration will be changed, the button to write the updated configuration into the UniLog, will be enabled.
