	Device Dialog Introduction</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
</DIV>
<P>The Picolario device dialog is used to read logged data out of the
device. For later data visualization adaption the two inner
tabulators enables data configuration according your needs. Depending
of the available data the configuration requires more or less
adaption. For adjustment the following options can be used :</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>Leave height values untouched</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>Subtract first height value from subsequent (it's
	the normal case)</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>Subtract last height value from preceding (late
	start of data logging)</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>Height offset</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>Slope calculation type</P>
</UL>
<P>A lot of hints are available by tool tips of the dialog itself and
make this help nearly obsolete. The tool tips are visible by hovering
the mouse over the fields of interest. 
</P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Usage</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P>Afterwards the serial communication is configured using the device
selection dialog and this dialog is opened, the only active button
„Read number records“ must be pushed to read the actual available
record number from the device (prerequisite is the Picolario is ready
to transfer data). A sample result is shown in picture 1. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_1.png" NAME="Image 1" ALT="Image 1">
</P>
<P>In the second step it is possible to adjust the data configuration
using one of the inner tabs. The visible tab will be used to
manipulate data for visualization of the current red data. Normally a
good choice is what is stored as default. If any further adjustment
is required it can be done after reading the data. 
</P>
<P>As third step each single data set can read one after the other by
select the record number and push the „Read selected record“. A
better method is to read all the data in series. Depending the amount
of data this can take a time. It is possible to display each data set
in the display right after finishing read operation. To achieve this
behavior the check box „Display data set right after read finished“
must be checked. To view and manipulate red data sets it is good to
set the device dialogs not in application modal mode (application
preferences). 
</P>
<P>An active device dialog is shown in next picture. 
</P>

</P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>The Configuration Tabulators</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P>As mentioned in the introduction section the visualization of the
data can be adapted as required. Do the height values require an
offset of an amount what is not offered be combo selection a manual
overwriting of the entry is possible. <BR>The slope calculation might
be performed using different algorithm and time intervals. A linear
regression results in better smoothed curve, but as drawback a phase
shift against the height curve can be recognized. This drawback is
eliminated by using the none linear variant of the regression
calculation, to simplify it's called „curve“. <BR>To get the
slope value at a point of interest it is possible to measure it by
context menu selection Curve Selector -&gt; Height -&gt; Context menu
-&gt; Point difference. <BR>Mainly two variants of curve adaption
takes place in the daily usage. This is the reason to have the two
inner tabulators to adjust the two configuration types independent.
<BR>To permanent use the other adjusted configuration tab values it
is possible to shift the data set to use the other configuration tab.
Therefor simply select the different tab according the channel
configuration selector (the different one which is displayed in front
after opening the dialog). The application ask if you really want to
do this and shows the following message box. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_3.png" NAME="Image 3" ALT="Image 3">
</P>
<P>If the answer is yes, the data set uses the new configuration
values of the selected tabs. 
</P>
<P><B>Note :</B> After each display configuration change the visual
data are adapted to be displayed using the new values. If new values
should be used as defaults for the next data gathering operation the
configuration adjustment can be made persistent by pushing the
„Persist settings as defaults“. 
</P>
<P>The height can be displayed in feet by adapting the following in
the Picolario.xml device configuration file from <BR>&lt;Property
description=&quot;Height calculation Feet to Meter (1852 / 6076)&quot;
type=&quot;Double&quot; value=&quot;<B>0.304806</B>&quot;
name=&quot;factor&quot;/&gt; to <BR>&lt;Property description=&quot;Height
calculation Feet to Meter (1852 / 6076)&quot; type=&quot;Double&quot;
value=&quot;<B>1.0</B>&quot; name=&quot;factor&quot;/&gt; <BR>and the
section where the unit is given from <BR>&lt;unit&gt;<B>m</B>&lt;/unit&gt;
to &lt;unit&gt;<B>feet</B>&lt;/unit&gt;. <BR>The file can be found in
application configurations directory under ../Devices/Picolario.xml. 
</P>
<P>The main sense of the configuration tabs will focus on the statistic data.
This is the reason the tabs are re-named to "Thermal" and "Motor". 
Using the motor configuration it is tried to filter the parts where a running motor can be assumed.
The statistic values focus on the filtered areas (refer to the screen shots as example).
</P>

	<IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_4.png" NAME="Image 4" ALT="Image 4 showing a sample statistic of the thermal configuration">
	<IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_5.png" NAME="Image 5" ALT="Image 5 showing a sample statistic of the motor configuration">
</P> 
<P> 
Later it is planned, to enable modification of the values needed for the statistic calculation by the dialog.
