<P>
The device dialog should be used to configure the visualization of measurements.
It is possible to update measurement names and symbols. 
Even if the measurement units are editable it makes less sense to do without adding a measurement factor in respect to the change.
The units are contained within the log data and get overwritten while reading.
Unchecked measurement will not be displayed. 
This will lead to a more clear representation, curves which are hard to be interpreted in two dimensional way, may be blanked out.
It is possible to import data files using the 'import data' button as well.
</BR>
Curves without reasonable data are not displayed.
As example, if no GPS is connected the GPS relevant curves doesn't get displayed.
The GPS data measurement values are the once which have a strict alignment to measurement ordinals to enable a check of reasonable GPS data and diplay export capabilities.
While GPS data are available it is possible to load and display such data in Google Earth using KMZ files.
This files can be exported using the file menu or directly launched to an installed Google Earth application.
How to do so, refer to <A HREF="../../../help/en/HelpInfo_36.html">Toolbar -> Google Earth</A>.

<P>
Multiplex sensors are to be configured by addresses, the configured address is displayed as measurement symbol, the units are overtaken.
The dialog allows changing the symbols, but this is not required and the symbols are overwritten with the next data import.
The measurement names needs to be assigned to have a meaningful association and a differentiation between the measurement curves.
If the sensor address keeps unchanged the associated measurement names don't get overwritten.
There are already two pre-configured measurement configurations to support different sets of sensors and address associations. 
Using the device properties editor it would be possible to add some more, if this is really required.
</P>
<P>At the right hand side of the configuration panel are check boxes which enable a semi automatic scale synchronization.
While checking measurement name will be compared to previous once and the fitting measurement ordinal will be added to the measurement configuration entry.
Using scale synchronization will reduce the required space for scales and spend more for the graphics. 
Overlaying curves in this matter will allow direct comparison without using the curve compare window.
</P>
<P>
Is is reasonable to think about the sequence and usage of the sensors (sample: Current/Voltage/Capacity - motor battery) before capture data.
Afterwards adapt and save the configuration without loading data.
The names of curves should be unique for this device if possible, sample CurrentMotor, CurrentRx, VoltageMotor, VoltageRx.
Please choose the curve names, in case of scale synchronization, in a way that the names starts with the same word, 
sample Current synchronized to <I>Current</I>Motor, <I>Current</I>Rx, <I>Current</I>Motor2.
This is the algorithm the semi-automatic synchronization works.
Using the DevicePropertiesEditor it is possible to synchronize almost every curve to another by configuration.
Sure, this makes only sense for curves where use somehow matching range of values.
Now it time to import data and cross check again if the unit, symbol a name matches the requirements.
Symbols are optional (Current I [A], Voltage U [V], ...).
Do the curves and data match it is possible to select the synchronization check boxes.
Finally save the configuration again.
</BR>
To archive all capabilities of DataExplorer's statistical calculations refer to <A HREF="../../../help/de/HelpInfo_5.html">Statistic View Window</A>.
</P>
<P><B>Hint: </B>While changing curve names, symbols units or synchronization entries the device configuration file gets changed.
With a later version of DataExplorer the device properties schema might change (DeviceProperties_Vxy.xsd), 
in this case a backup copy of the complete device configurations will be created (Devices_Vxy-1.xsd) and your change will remain there.
The out dated device configuration file can be used as template to update the new version.
