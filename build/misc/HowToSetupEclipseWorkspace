How to setup eclipse workspace to build the DataExplorer

== Prepare your system ==
- Install the JDK (prefer 64-Bit to enable full system heap usage)
- Install Eclipse
- Install ant-contrib from http://ant-contrib.sourceforge.net/ or use jar from build/ant folder after project import
- Make sure that the ANT classpath (Window > Preferences > Ant > Runtime) is correct, containing...
  - all the jars from Eclipse's org.apache.ant plugin directory
  - the tools.jar from the JDK's lib directory
  - the ant-contrib jar
- Check that the file encoding is set to UTF-8 (Window > Preferences > General > Workspace)
- install git for your operating system, git contains also ssh functionality to make it easier for WIndows users
  (for Windows install check-out and commit in UNIX style to enable cross platform development)

== Setup DataExplorer in Eclipse ==
- Check out all projects via CVS (https://savannah.nongnu.org/cvs/?group=dataexplorer). Checking out only specific projects won't work, as the build files expect all projects to exist
- Clone git repository outside on a command shell or bash shell
  - Create a directory for instance ../git and change directory into it, do not create this directory below your workspace 
  - Anonymous clone: git clone git://git.savannah.nongnu.org/dataexplorer.git
  - Member clone:    git clone <membername>@git.sv.gnu.org:/srv/git/dataexplorer.git
- Eclipse -> Import -> Git -> Projects from git -> existing local repository -> select the folder dataexplorer below your git folder
  - Import existing projects -> all projects should be automatically selected -> OK
- Next, configure the needed classpath variable:
  - Window > Preferences > Java > Build Path > Classpath Variables
    - Add "SWT_JAR_PATH" with the appropriate path to your system in "build/lib/<OS>/<osarch>/swt.jar"
    - Add "USB4JAVA_PATH" with the appropriate path to your system in "build/lib/<OS>/<osarch>/libusb4java-1.2.0.jar"
- Complete Ant libraries if not already done
- Open the properties editor of Eclipse
  - Enable project specific settings for "Clean Up" and "Formatter"
    - Import the settings from "build/setup" (code_cleanup_preferences.xml and code_format_preferences.xml)
  - Java -> Compiler -> Compliance Level -> 1.8 
- Build and update capabilities
  - Configure build/build.properties install.dir to your requirements (used by "clean dev-build install" to local directory, take care about permissions)
  (install.dir.windows=C:/Program\ Files\ (x86) )

== Prepare stuff ==
- In the "build" project, locate the file "build build.xml clean dev-build.launch"
  - Right-click on it and choose "Run as"
    - Select the first entry from the context menu to create all needed directories and files within

== Start the application within Eclipse ==
- In the DataExplorer project, locate the file "DataExplorer.launch", right-click on it and choose "Debug as > Java Application"
- Linux user should add -DSWT_GTK3=0 as argument for the launcher
