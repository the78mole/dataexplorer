</DIV>
<P>With the Ultra Duo Plus device dialog you are able to configure device identification name, button sound, etc..
The main configuration tasks are the naming from battery memories and its battery type, capacity and charge, discharge and cycle parameter.
</P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Usage</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P>If the serial communication port is selected using the device selection dialog, 
the port will be automatically opened while opening the dialog and some configuration data will be gathered from the device.
To select the battery memories the drop down gets used.
The adjustment of the parameter values can be done by using the slider on right hand side or when value field has white background by typing.
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_1.png" NAME="Image1" ALT="Image1">
</P>
<P><B>Hint : </B>It is important to specify a device identifier name. Since this name is used as identifier for a data cache.
The data cache gets created during first opening of the configuration dialog.
Therefore the first open takes a few seconds longer than afterward.
If the cache is filled and in sync with the device data can be seen by activating the backup/restore buttons.
</P>
<P>The following pictures displays charge, discharge and cycle parameters for a NiMH battery.

<P>The following picture displays the step charge parameters tabulator, which is only enabled for a NiMH battery.

<P><B>Hint : </B>Only parameters gets displayed for configuration purpose which has a relevance for the selected cell type.
The configuration of step charge parameters are actually not possible and is part of future release.
</P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Data gathering</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P>To start data capturing simply push the "start gathering" button.
Do this while the charger is prepared, charge process configured, battery connected.
Right after starting the gathering process at the DataExplorer start the charge process at device.
Only this sequence guarantees that the complete charging process gets captured.
Switching between charge, discharge and other curve types is enabled automatically by values received from the device.
While a new curve gets created the graphical visualization switches to this data set at the certain outlet data channel.
The picture below showing a graph of a linked charged LiPo battery with 8 cells.
Only curves gets displayed which contain data. Therefore there is a skip in CellVoltage numbers between 4 and 8. 
This relates to the balancer outlets where the batteries are connected.
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_6.png" NAME="Image6 charge process LiPo LINK" ALT="Image6 charge process LiPo LINK">
</P>
<P>
If the device is inactive for a certain time frame the serial communication port gets closed.
</P>
<H3><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Automatic Object Selection</I></FONT></FONT></H3>
<P>Charging devices which are capable to manage battery memories forwards this possibility to automatic object key selection.
</BR>As pre-requisite the configuration dialog must be used to configure the battery memories.
During the configuration activity a configuration file gets created and is used as data cache.
The configured device name is part of the file identifier.
While the data gathering gets started the device identifier name will be read. Afterwards the normal gathering will begin.
Receiving the first data from the device, the process memory number is known.
With the battery memory number the memory name can be looked up.
The battery name is now used to find a best match from object key list.
If a good match can be found the object key gets selected while creating the first data set.
</P>
<P>How to match the object name while there is no complete containment ?
</BR>The battery memory name gets split at blank, hyphen and under bar.
The name fragments are now used to find partially matches.
The object name which has the most containment hits get selected.
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_7.png" NAME="Image7 Battery memory - object match" ALT="Image7 Battery memory - object match">
</P>
<P><B>Hint : </B>To have good matching results, name battery memories as well as object key names accordingly.
Both names battery memory name as well as object key name can be renamed if required
</P>
<H3><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Battery Cycle Data History</I></FONT></FONT></H3>
<P>Using the Battery Data tab of the UltraDuoPlus dialog it is possible to query battery history data, cycle data.
Doing this result in a new utility graphics tab, called Battery History, in the main application window. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_8.png" NAME="Image8 Battery Cycle Data" ALT="Image8 Battery Cycle Data"></P>
<P><B>Hint : </B>Only data gets displayed which are taken within the last two years of the selected battery memory.
</P>
<P>Through device date miss adjustment it is possible to collect wrong data in respect of time stamp. 
If such a time stamp will be detected a small dialog gets opened to enable correction.
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_9.png" NAME="Image9 Correction Dialog" ALT="Image9 Correction Dialog"></P>
<P>How it is possible to correlate such entries regarding the time stamps?
Just skip all the correction dialogs and have a brief look at the table which now contains all the entries red from device.
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_10.png" NAME="Image10 Dialog Battery History" ALT="Image10 Dialog Battery History"></P>
<P>Using saved DataExplorer files of the selected battery, statistics tab, you will find which entries have a mismatch.
Afterwards just run the history query again and correct the entries where a matching file was found.
