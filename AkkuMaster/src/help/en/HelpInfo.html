	C4 device dialog introduction</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
</DIV>
<P>The AkkuMaster C4 device dialog is to be used to view, adjust and
gather data from AkkuMaster discharge and charge processes. It is
possible to configure each outlet independent from the others. A
configuration which overloads the charger is impossible, since the
individual loads are accumulated and the resulting total current will
be displayed. <BR><B>Note : </B>If a data gathering process is
active, it is not possible to close the dialog. Each outlet channel
may gather data in parallel and can be displayed individual. To
switch between outlets will not been possible if device dialog is
modal adjusted in application preferences. 
</P>
<P>A lot of hints are available by tool tips of the dialog itself and
make this help nearly obsolete. The tool tips are visible by hovering
the mouse over the fields of interest. 
</P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Version information</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P>Afterwards the serial communication is configured using the device
selection dialog the device version information is gathered in
background while opening the dialog. This may lead into serial
communication error, if the configured port can't be opened. The
device dialog with the actual EPROM version from manufacturer is
shown in picture 1 displaying version information.

<P>After selecting an outlet tab only the two radio buttons are
active. Other senseless buttons are disabled for the moment.

<P>If, as usual, the charge/discharge process is started at the
device, the selection of “Gather data only” the displayed process
parameters are updated. Additionally the “Start” button gets
activated to enable the start of the gathering process (picture 3). 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_3.png" NAME="Image 3" ALT="Image 3" ALIGN=BOTTOM WIDTH=440 HEIGHT=590 BORDER=0>
</P>
<P>After the start button is pushed all the graphics displays are
updated by the gathering cycle. The stop button gets activated to
enable stopping of the process for some cases. New data sets get
created while the device switch between charge and discharge. The
gathering process stops automatically if the device signals no
activity anymore.</P>
<P><B>Note : </B>Stopping the data gathering process will also stop
the running process of the connected device for safety reasons!</P>
<H3><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Configured process</I></FONT></FONT></H3>
<P>While using “Configured process” the data configuring the
future process are updated with the actual values depending the the
current adjusted values of the selected outlet. Afterwards you can
modify the values according your choice. Since the program must be
loaded into the devices EPROM before it can be executed the adjusted
values are written into the selected memory. <BR><BR><BR>
</P>
<P><B>Note : </B>Since it is not possible to query data for the
selected memory, I prefer to do all program configuration direct at
the device and use “Data gather only” for data gathering.</P>
<P>If a memory index will be modified from which is red from the
device the background of the combo box is colored the make this
change more visible. Such a situation is shown in picture below.<BR><BR><BR>

<P>To close the device dialog is only possible while no gathering
processes are active. While closing the dialog the serial port is
closed as well.</P>
