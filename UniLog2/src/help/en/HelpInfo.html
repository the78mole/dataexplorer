<P>The device dialog should be used to configure the visualization of measurements.
Unchecked measurement will not be displayed. 
</BR>
There are two different data set configurations. This configurations are used for statistics calculations only.
Only the Motor type configuration contains current level trigger to measure the motor runtime and calculate the reached height.
For the climb flights used battery capacity is required to calculate a reference value of the needed capacity per height meter.
While loading the data the actual selected configuration will be used to display and calculate statistics.
It is possible to move the data to the other configuration with opened dialog and selecting the different configuration tab.
</BR>
It is possible to import log data files using the 'import data' button as well.
</P>

<P>Entering the revolution were the Propeller drives 100 Watts, enable to calculate the Efficiency.
Well, this calculation is not very accurate, but it helps for comparison.
</P>
<P><B>Hint: </B>The visualization configuration will be applied as well as it is closed in cases where the tool bar button is used to import the data.
</P>
<P>
If required for analog measurement sensors a measurement offset as well as a factor can be configured using the device properties editor.
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_2.png" NAME="HelpInfo_Image_2" ALT="HelpInfo_Image_2"></P>
<P>
If Multiplex sensors are connected, the units are overtaken from the log data as well. The names and symbols must be manually adapted.
The initial presets are only samples.
Multiplex M-Link sensor measurements has always a trailing '_ML'.
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_3.png" NAME="HelpInfo_Image_3" ALT="HelpInfo_Image_3"></P>
<P>At the right hand side of the configuration panel are check boxes which enable a semi automatic scale synchronization.
While checking measurement name will be compared to previous once and the fitting measurement ordinal will be added to the measurement configuration entry.
Using scale synchronization will reduce the required space for scales and spend more for the graphics. 
Overlaying curves in this matter will allow direct comparison without using the curve compare window.
</P>
<H4>Multiplex Sensors and Curve Names</H4>
<P>
Is is reasonable to think about the sequence and usage of the sensors (sample: Current/Voltage/Capacity - motor battery) before import data.
Afterwards adapt and save the configuration without loading data.
The names of curves should be unique for this device if possible, sample CurrentMotor, CurrentRx, VoltageMotor, VoltageRx.
Please choose the curve names, in case of scale synchronization, in a way that the names starts with the same word, 
sample Current synchronized to <I>Current</I>Motor, <I>Current</I>Rx, <I>Current</I>Motor2.
This is the algorithm the semi-automatic synchronization works.
Using the DevicePropertiesEditor it is possible to synchronize almost every curve to another by configuration.
Sure, this makes only sense for curves where use somehow matching range of values.
Now it time to import data and cross check again if the unit, symbol a name matches the requirements.
Symbols are optional (Current I [A], Voltage U [V], ...).
Do the curves and data match it is possible to select the synchronization check boxes.
Finally save the configuration again.
</P>
<P><B>Hint: </B>While changing curve names, symbols units or synchronization entries the device configuration file gets changed.
With a later version of DataExplorer the device properties schema might change (DeviceProperties_Vxy.xsd), 
in this case a backup copy of the complete device configurations will be created (Devices_Vxy-1.xsd) and your change will remain there.
The out dated device configuration file can be used as template to update the new version.
</P>
<H3><A NAME="configuration"><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=3><I>Device Setup</I></FONT></FONT></H3>
<P>The last main tabulator enables loading device setup data from file as well as change and save direct to the SD-card.
While switching to the tab the file selection dialog will be opened. As required this can be skipped or repeated. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="HelpInfo_Image_4.png" NAME="HelpInfo_Image_4" ALT="HelpInfo_Image_4"></P>
<P>
It is possible to configure a number of alarm thresholds for different measurement values.
</P> 
<P><B>Hint: </B>A preset directory path is configurable using the device properties editor on tab, Data Block - Optional Entries - data path.
This configuration will position the file open dialog at the directory where the data files can directly be selected at the point where the SD-card is mounted.
To load the setup file change into 'SM UniLog 2 setup' directory.
