<H0>DataExplorer - Users Guide</H0>
<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>The GNU DataExplorer is a tool to gather, view and analyze data which comes from devices 
with a serial data port or other like CSV-file or USB port. 
The application itself runs on several operating system with 32 or 64 bit processor (GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS) 
and is enabled for national language support. 
Actual English and German is packaged. 
Devices might be data logger, measurement devices, charging devices or similar. 
</P>
<P>A fundamental idea for the development is the system
comprehensive thought. For none Windows user the same functionality
should be made available as it is today by using LogView for Windows.
This is the reason to base the implementation on Java using the free
available RXTXcomm library, for the serial communication and the eclipse
SWT library for the graphical user interface. For both libraries a
native interface for Windows, GNU/Linux and Mac OS is available. For
development the eclipse IDE (integrated development environment)
together with the Java 6 runtime is used.
</P>
<P>What is the naming for serial interfaces on different operating
systems: 
<IMG SRC="../src/help/en/images/SerialPortAssignements.jpg" NAME="graphics1">
</P>
<H2>Why free software using GPL</H2>
<P>In fundamental there are two reasons. 
The software follows the freedom of software idea. 
Using GPL will makes the source code available for every one. 
Therefore the GNU DataExplorer makes all interfaces for device communication and the data model is freely available. 
This will finally gives everybody the power to enhance the applications (for own needs) with new functionality, 
add new devices and fix errors.
</BR>
The device specific components are separate
modules and are bind dynamically during runtime (plug-in). This enables
developer to develop the device plug-ins disconnected from the main
application. There is a sample implementation which can be used as entry
point. To implement a device plug-in three facets are touched: the
device itself, knowledge how to use the device and a communication
specification (of course programming knowledge).</P>
<H2>A few words to Java</H2>
<P>A Java applications lives within extra for it started
&quot;Virtual Machine&quot; (VM), this runtime environment is as fist
approximation equal for all different system platforms. Therefore a Java
application can be executed everywhere, where a Java runtime exist. The
VM provides the available memory. Different to an application written in
C a Java application can only use the memory provided by the JVM what is
different to the system wide provided memory. This means while starting
the JVM for a Java application the memory consumption limits must be
provide (-Xms/-Xmx). If no values are provided, a maximum value of 128
Mbyte is used as default. A VM sounds like a system sandbox where there
is no possibility to break through barriers. Would this the truth, there
would probably no serial communication and no graphics library. Prior to
announcement of the just in time compilers (JIT) Java applications are
slow and came with its own visualization skin. Actual Java applications
are very close to applications written in other programming languages in
viewpoint of comfort and speed. Using the &quot;Java Native
Interface&quot; it is possible to communicate direct with hardware
device drivers. In this area mostly C applications are used to execute
this job. This is the case with RXTXcomm and as well SWT. Using Java a
very big number of freely available libraries are available as well as
libraries provided by GPL license. All of his can be used in commercial
applications as well.</P>
<H2>Used Directories</H2>
<P><B>HINT: </B>Please do not use an installation path containing special characters like mutated vowel. 
Java use as standard UTF-8 character encoding, while translating special characters can lead into an error situation.
</P>
<P>Which directories are created during installation are described
in the README file. More important are the directories used during
runtime of the application storing settings, log files and graphics
templates.</P>
<P>As base directory the application is using:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Windows&nbsp;:&nbsp;%APPDATA%\username\DataExplorer
	<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GNU/Linux&nbsp;:&nbsp;/home/username/.DataExplorer
	<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;MAC OS&nbsp;:&nbsp;/Users/username/Library/Application/DataExplorer
</UL>
<P>At this start point for directories the following is used and
created</P>
<UL>
	<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Devices&nbsp;:&nbsp;for device properties (XML) and device pictures
	<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;GraphicsTemplates&nbsp;:&nbsp;for files describing the graphical properties like line color, number format, etc.
	<LI>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Logs&nbsp;:&nbsp;for trace log files, do not mix with the device log data files
</UL>
<P>This should enough as overview. Later in this document we will dive deeper in details.</P>
<P>How get the data organized which contains the measurement values.
A root folder or directory needs to be defined (refer to <A href=HelpInfo1.html>preferences dialog</A>), underneath each used device get its own data files folder.
The device folder are the same as the chosen device names. In addition folder gets created for each created object.
While saving the data a file name proposal according the configuration in <A href=HelpInfo1.html>preferences dialog</A> will be displayed.
As example Date_Object_Name.osd. Is there a relation of the saved to an object, an object is selected while saving, a file link gets created in the object folder pointing to
the file in the device folder. 
File links only needs a few bytes disk space, since its only a relation to the data file.
There is no duplication of data files.
While opening object related files only this object files are visible.
As example you will find the battery of object XY when its last time charged.
A simple folder structure should give a better overview :
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../src/help/en/images/DataDirectoryStructure.png"	NAME="Data directory structure" ALIGN=MIDDLE></P>
<P><B>Hint: </B>Since file links are operating system specific ther is a capability to clean up and re-create all file links (refer to <A href=HelpInfo1.html>preferences dialog</A>). 
Moving your data to a different operating system is easy now.
</P>
<H2>The Main Application Window</H2>
<P>In the title bar of the application the name of the application
itself and if applicable the loaded file name, the associated device
name and the communication port name is displayed. As usual for this
type of application a menu bar as well as a tool bar is available. The
central area is build from windows reachable by tabs. This area will
present the data in several form. The graphical view which presents the
data using curves is the real main view. All other windows are detail
views in other representation form.</P>
<IMG SRC="../src/help/en/images/ApplicationMainWindow.png"	NAME="graphics1" ALIGN=MIDDLE>
<P>At the bottom there is a status bar to display serial
communication status, like connected, receiving and transmitting. Aside
the communication port status a progress bar is placed to show progress
of long therm operations. The rest of this status area is used to
display warning messages or measurement results.</P>
<H1>The Preferences Dialog</H1>
<H2>General Tab</H2>

<P>The settings dialog is used to configure:
<UL>
	<LI>the language to be used
	<LI>the data path, where the application is locking for and
	placing the device specific log data files and file links.
	<LI>the file save dialog might be use the current date and/or object name as leader	of the file name. This will help to find files.
	<LI>behavior of the device dialogs. A primary modal behavior is
	some times not handy, if some adjustments are the place in parallel while
	gathering data. Some times this cost more effort while programming
	this.
	<LI>decimal separator and list separator characters. This might
	be different then the character used from system locale to work together with the spread sheet programs.
	This adjustment is used for import/export of CSV files, but has no influence while importing <A HREF="HelpInfo_C.html">CSV2SerialAdapter Data Format</A> files.
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../src/help/en/images/Settingsdialog_1.png" NAME="graphics 1" ALIGN=CENTER >
</P>
	<LI>using black-list or white-list configuration it is possible to configure according personal problematic ports.
	This configuration is also valid for the device selection dialog, where device individual ports are selected.
	Configure the black-list will ignore ports declared. On the other hand the white-list will exclusive use the configured ports.
	Using the white list it is possible to miss ports dynamically configured by the system. 
	<LI>while it scans for available serial ports
	and updates the results delayed. The delay can be reduced on slow
	systems by switching off the availability check. If this is the case
	used ports are displayed too which might not be used in future. 
	At UNIX based systems this is not relevant. 
	This adjustment reflect also to the device selection dialog
	which also scans for available serial ports.
	<LI>if system wide only one serial port is available it is
	possible to configure a global serial port usage, but in most cases the
	single available port will be found automatically. Activating this check box will start the port update scan.
</UL>
</P>
<H2>Miscellaneous Tab</H2>
<P>
Pushing the buttons will create a desktop launcher icon or remove it from desktop.
The other two buttons enable the DataExplorer MIME type registration to associate the file endings *.osd and *.lov or remove this registration.
</P>
<P align=center><IMG SRC="../src/help/en/images/Settingsdialog_3.png" NAME="graphics 3" ALIGN=CENTER></P>
<P>The button "Create Link Files" will scan all OSD files under the configured folder and create all missing object directories as well as the associating link files.
The button "Clean Link File" will delete object related link files but not the object description files nor the object related directories.
This function helps to move data files to different system/platform or for backup purpose. 
</P>
<H2>Analysis Tab</H2>
<P>
Using the analyze tab only adjustments for problem analysis can
be found. After a program failure function a trace log entry should
appear which may help to find the reason for it appearance. Pay
attention, modifying trace log level away from INFO will result in
slowed down execution and may lead in unknown side effects. So adjust this
values using this knowledge. The adjustments are scaled in detail level,
<UL>
	<LI>SEVERE writes only program execution errors,
	<LI>WARNING writing errors and warnings,  (default)
	<LI>TIME writing errors, warnings and time relevant log statements
	<LI>INFO writing errors, warnings and some informational,
	<LI>FINE writing all errors warnings and informational, in
	addition traces of the level fine,
	<LI>FINER writing more than FINE
	<li>FINEST writing more than FINER
</UL>
</P>
<P>The below described part allows to configure the log level class based. 
To keep the log file content small do not adjust the log level above FINE. 
Otherwise the amount of log statements is very high.
<UL>
	<LI>the global setting of the &quot;trace log&quot; level, is in
	normal the level INFO
	<LI>graphical user interface, here all statements are included
	called during main window execution
	<LI>devices, all statements called during device relevant
	execution
	<LI>data model, all executions involved by the data model itself
	<LI>utility functions, all the helper functions, drawing curves,
	calculate check sum, etc.
	<LI>file I/O, function calls involved in file input/output
	<LI>serial I/O, will used a memory logger above the level INFO to
	archive a low performance impact. As logical consequence the memory
	usage of the application is higher as before. It might be required to
	start the application using &quot;java -jar -Xmx512m
	DataExplorer.jar&quot; where the maximal memory usage is
	limited to 512 Mbyte.
</UL>
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><img src="../src/help/en/images/Settingsdialog_2.png" name="graphics 2" ALIGN=CENTER >
</P>
<P>The class based log level allows to set a logging level for selected class(es) which reduce the amount of trace statements and helps analyzing class centric.
A context menu enables the log level selection.
Closing the settings dialog will activate the adjusted trace level.
</P>
<P>In every case only three level of trace log files are written
with a limited size. The files in this rolled approach will over write
after a certain amount of statements.</P>
<P><B>Hint: </B>In case of error please have a look into the trace
log files this will give help indicators to fix the problem (refer to  <A HREF="HelpInfo_01.html">Used Directories</A>).</P>

<H1>The Device Selection Dialog</H1>
<P>Using the device selection dialog the devices are chosen which
are available for the application. The device selection and port
overview all devices are listed which are found by available device
properties XML file in the &quot;Devices&quot; directory.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../src/help/en/images/DeviceSelectionDialog_1.png" NAME="graphics1" align="middle"></P>
<P>The selection of the active device will be done with the
&quot;Preferences&quot; tab.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../src/help/en/images/DeviceSelectionDialog_2.png" NAME="graphics2" align="middle"></P>
<P>The selection of the active device can be done in several places
on this tab. First place is the combo box direct above the device
picture or with the slider at right hand side of the combo. The picture
of the just selected device will be shown. Additional information
related to the device is shown at the right hand side of the picture.
Direct underneath this device info two selections are available to
configure device specific behavior regarding device dialog and
communication port.</P>
<P><B>Hint : </B>Another possibility selecting the active device is
using the next-/previous- device buttons in the tool bar.</P>
<P>Underneath the device picture the serial port must be selected.
Is there only one serial port available at the current system this port
will be selected for communication purpose automatically. The pictures
below showing a port selection with COM4 using a Windows system and a
port of a serial to USB adapter of a GNU/Linux system /dev/ttyUSB0.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../src/help/en/images/DeviceSelectionDialogWindows_3.png" NAME="graphics3" align="middle"></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../src/help/en/images/DeviceSelectionDialogLinux_3.png" NAME="graphics4" align="middle"></P>
<P>With the âvisualization preferencesâ group the visibility of
some application tabs can be configured. 
Very small systems might be slowed down if to many data has to be updated while live data gathering.</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../src/help/en/images/DeviceSelectionDialog_4.png" NAME="graphics4" align="middle"></P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../src/help/en/images/DeviceSelectionDialog_4a.png" NAME="graphics4a" align="middle"></P>
<P>The check boxes in the middle, Digital and Analog, are used
mainly for live data measurements and have less sense for devices
without this capability. If a device does not have live data capability
or data are red from file the end values of the curve are displayed. The
visualization of single cell voltages makes only sense for device with
the capability to show this, mainly Lithium battery charger or balancer.
</BR>
Check boxes in the lower section there are more device specific and can only be checked by changing the device configuration files.
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../src/help/en/images/DeviceSelectionDialog_5.png" NAME="graphics6" align="middle"></P>
<P>At the lower area the serial communication parameters are
displayed without the possibility to change it. Required changes can
only be done by editing the device properties XML directly.</P>
<H1><A NAME="menue_bar"></A>Menu- and Tool- Bar</H1>
<P>The menu bar make all elements available to manage the
application. The tool bar enable the most often used elements using

Switching the implementation active, the implementing device class name has to be configured, optional as full qualified including the package.
The implementation can always used if an equal device implementation class is already available, and/or if the device name does not fit.
As an example the CSV2SerialAdapter has several devices using this implementation, differences exist in the data block specification.
As additional example the several copies of the Bantam charger devices can be named, where differences exist in cover design and device name.
The captured data should be found under the directory followed the device name, isn't it.

A value greater than 0 milli seconds as time step between the measurement points is voted as constant time gap.
The time step value lower than 0 milli seconds signals that the device gives individual time steps.
This must not mean that the time steps might not constant.
The implementation for the particular device must handle this situation.
</P>
<P><B>Hint : </B>The UniLog, as example, uses an adjustable but constant time step between measurement points.
Therefore the time step is -1 msec.

to keep some configuration data optional similar to optional XML
elements. The read functions will construct at first a HashMap of the
key/values and apply only the values of existing keys. All other are
default. 
Measurement data point are stored without any change as integer values.
This enable to have all data files structure the same, there is no difference between devices.

<H1><A NAME="introduction"></A>CSV2SerialAdapter Data Format</H1>
<P>The text data format is a standard "Comma Separated Values" CSV-file as it is used by spread sheet applications as well.
The alignment of data (values) is common for a lot of battery charger devices.
The LogView application also can import this type of data and is named as "OpenFormat".
Due to the platform comprehensive approach of the DataExplorer, it is required to make the specification more complete.
As example different execution platforms used different new line characters, p.e. Windows &lt;CR&gt;&lt;LF&gt; while creating a file.
On the other hand it must be secured that files created on different platforms, with specific new line characters, can be interpreted, p.e. GNU/Linux &lt;LF&gt; or Mac &lt;CR&gt;. 
Refer to the DevicePropertiesEditor <A HREF="HelpInfo_A1.html#device_properties_datablock">data block</A> description.

<P>The Picolario device dialog is used to read logged data out of the
device. For later data visualization adaption the two inner
tabulators enables data configuration according your needs. Depending
of the available data the configuration requires more or less
adaption. For adjustment the following options can be used :</P>
<UL>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>Leave height values untouched</P>
	<LI><P ALIGN=LEFT>Subtract first height value from subsequent (it's
	the normal case)</P>

</P>
<H2><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=4><I>Usage</I></FONT></FONT></H2>
<P>Afterwards the serial communication is configured using the device
selection dialog and this dialog is opened, the only active button
âRead number recordsâ must be pushed to read the actual available
record number from the device (prerequisite is the Picolario is ready
to transfer data). A sample result is shown in picture 1. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../Picolario/src/help/en/HelpInfo_Image_1.png" NAME="Image 1" ALT="Image 1">

<P>In the second step it is possible to adjust the data configuration
using one of the inner tabs. The visible tab will be used to
manipulate data for visualization of the current red data. Normally a
good choice is what is stored as default. If any further adjustment
is required it can be done after reading the data. 
</P>
<P>As third step each single data set can read one after the other by
select the record number and push the âRead selected recordâ. A
better method is to read all the data in series. Depending the amount
of data this can take a time. It is possible to display each data set
in the display right after finishing read operation. To achieve this
behavior the check box âDisplay data set right after read finishedâ

<P>As mentioned in the introduction section the visualization of the
data can be adapted as required. Do the height values require an
offset of an amount what is not offered be combo selection a manual
overwriting of the entry is possible. <BR>The slope calculation might
be performed using different algorithm and time intervals. A linear
regression results in better smoothed curve, but as drawback a phase
shift against the height curve can be recognized. This drawback is
eliminated by using the none linear variant of the regression
calculation, to simplify it's called âcurveâ. <BR>To get the
slope value at a point of interest it is possible to measure it by
context menu selection Curve Selector -&gt; Height -&gt; Context menu
-&gt; Point difference. <BR>Mainly two variants of curve adaption
takes place in the daily usage. This is the reason to have the two
inner tabulators to adjust the two configuration types independent.
<BR>To permanent use the other adjusted configuration tab values it
is possible to shift the data set to use the other configuration tab.
Therefor simply select the different tab according the channel
configuration selector (the different one which is displayed in front
after opening the dialog). The application ask if you really want to
do this and shows the following message box. 
</P>
<P ALIGN=CENTER><IMG SRC="../../Picolario/src/help/en/HelpInfo_Image_3.png" NAME="Image 3" ALT="Image 3">
</P>
<P>If the answer is yes, the data set uses the new configuration
values of the selected tabs. 
</P>
<P><B>Note :</B> After each display configuration change the visual
data are adapted to be displayed using the new values. If new values
should be used as defaults for the next data gathering operation the
configuration adjustment can be made persistent by pushing the

<P>Each change will be immediate change the data set visualization. A
change will also activate the âPersist adjustments as defaultâ
button to make the configuration composition persistent and will be
used next time data are gets applied to this configuration.
</P>
<P>Special are the 3 analog connectors (A1 to A3). All analog outlets are
pre-configured using the device settings (Settings tab). This will
adjust UniLog internal measurement adjustment. 
While reading data this UniLog internal settings are used to adjust name and unit for each analog measurement.
If required for the connected sensor an offset as well as a factor can
be used for adaption. A change will activate the âPersist
adjustments as defaultâ button to enable to persist the change for
later repeated usage. 
</P>
<P>If a data set is just displayed while opening the dialog the dialog
tab with the matching configuration is displayed on top. Does the
data set displayed not match the configuration the configuration might
be adapted or a better matching configuration selecting another tab
can be selected. By doing this a message box pops up to commit or
de-commit this operation. 
</P>
<P>
Different configurations enable different statistics data calculation.
As sample the next screen shot displays a receiver configuration statistics view.

For later it is planned to enable the adaption of the statistic configuration by a dialog.
</P>
<P><B>Hint : </B>If four configurations are to much it can be
reduced. This requires to comment out channel configuration in
UniLog.xml (&lt;!-- XML comment --&gt;). More then four
configurations are possible but the current implementation does not
support. 
</P>
<P>Of course it is possible to activate all measurements in the
configuration tab and filter using the curve selector.

<P>Using this tab it is possible to adjust all telemetry relevant configurations which are supported by the transmitter/receiver systems involved.
Actual supported transmitter/receiver systems are Jeti Duplex, Futaba and Multiplex M-Link, since UniLog firmware level 1.12.
At first the actual UniLog configuration should be red and afterwords, with help of the transmitter/receiver systems manual, change the configuration as required.

<H3><FONT FACE="Arial"><FONT SIZE=3>Data export in KML or GPX file format</FONT></FONT></H3>
<P>Using the file menu, File -> Export, it is possible to export GPS based data, if available, in the Google Earth KML data format,
as well as the "global positioning system" (GPS) exchange format GPX.
</BR>
Both data formats can be opened and viewed using the Google Earth application.
Google Earth is not capable to make height information visible, therefore the export using the relative height is recommended.
The GPX format enables to select track points where height information as well as speed will be made visible.
Using a GPX file with relative height it is not required to select "Adapt height to ground", which would eliminate the visible height information of the track.
