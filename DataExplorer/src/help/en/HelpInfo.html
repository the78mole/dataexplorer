<H1>Introduction</H1>
<P>The GNU DataExplorer is a tool to gather, view and analyze data which comes from devices 
with a serial data port or other like CSV-file or USB port. 
The application itself runs on several operating system with 32 or 64 bit processor (GNU/Linux, Windows, Mac OS) 
and is enabled for national language support. 
Actual English and German is packaged. 
Devices might be data logger, measurement devices, charging devices or similar. 
</P>
<P>A fundamental idea for the development is the system comprehensive thought. 
For all variants usual computer operating system it should be possible to gather measurement data and present this graphically.
Calculate statistics on the data as well.
For instance current and voltage of charging devices, data measurable working with electric motors or back channel data transmitted from radio controlled vehicles.
This is the reason to base the implementation on Java using the free
available RXTXcomm library, for the serial communication and the eclipse
SWT library for the graphical user interface. For both libraries a
native interface for Windows, GNU/Linux and Mac OS is available. For
development the eclipse IDE (integrated development environment)
together with the Java 6 runtime is used.
</P>
<P>What is the naming for serial interfaces on different operating
systems: 
<IMG SRC="images/SerialPortAssignements.jpg" NAME="graphics1">
</P>
<H2>Why free software using GPL</H2>
<P>In fundamental there are two reasons. 
The software follows the freedom of software idea. 
Using GPL will makes the source code available for every one. 
Therefore the GNU DataExplorer makes all interfaces for device communication and the data model is freely available. 
This will finally gives everybody the power to enhance the applications (for own needs) with new functionality, 
add new devices and fix errors.
</BR>
The device specific components are separate
modules and are bind dynamically during runtime (plug-in). This enables
developer to develop the device plug-ins disconnected from the main
application. There is a sample implementation which can be used as entry
point. To implement a device plug-in three facets are touched: the
device itself, knowledge how to use the device and a communication
specification (of course programming knowledge).</P>
<H2>A few words to Java</H2>
<P>A Java applications lives within extra for it started
&quot;Virtual Machine&quot; (VM), this runtime environment is as fist
approximation equal for all different system platforms. Therefore a Java
application can be executed everywhere, where a Java runtime exist. The
VM provides the available memory. Different to an application written in
C a Java application can only use the memory provided by the JVM what is
different to the system wide provided memory. This means while starting
the JVM for an Java application the memory consumption limits must be
provide (-Xms/-Xmx). If no values are provided, a maximum value of 128
Mbyte is used as default. A VM sounds like a system sandbox where there
is no possibility to break through barriers. Would this the truth, there
would probably no serial communication and no graphics library. Prior to
announcement of the just in time compilers (JIT) Java applications are
slow and came with its own visualization skin. Actual Java applications
are very close to applications written in other programming languages in
viewpoint of comfort and speed. Using the &quot;Java Native
Interface&quot; it is possible to communicate direct with hardware
device drivers. In this area mostly C applications are used to execute
this job. This is the case with RXTXcomm and as well SWT. Using Java a
very big number of freely available libraries are available as well as
libraries provided by GPL license. All of his can be used in commercial
applications as well.</P>
